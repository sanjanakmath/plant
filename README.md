Identification of Ayurvedic Medicine Plants Based on Leaf













Abstract
The identification and classification of Ayurvedic medicinal plants are vital for their proper application in natural and traditional treatments. This project proposes a deep learning-based system that automatically identifies various Ayurvedic plants using their leaf images. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in combination with Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features to enhance classification accuracy. The system extracts comprehensive color, texture, and statistical features from leaf images, followed by classification into specific plant categories such as Neem, Tulsi, Aloe Vera, and more. The model is trained and tested using a custom dataset, achieving high accuracy through optimized feature extraction and CNN architecture. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to facilitate real-time prediction using either uploaded leaf images or live webcam feeds, enhancing usability for researchers and practitioners in the herbal medicine domain.
